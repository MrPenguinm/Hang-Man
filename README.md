### 📌 Hangman Game Project - README  

#### 🚀 **Overview**  
This is a **Hangman Game** built using **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JSON**. The game dynamically loads words from an external `JSON` file, allowing for an easy expansion of word categories. It provides an interactive and visually appealing experience with smooth animations and a dark-themed design.

### 🎮 **How to Play**  
1. The game randomly selects a **word** from different **categories** (e.g., Programming, Animals, Movies, etc.).  
2. The category name is displayed as a hint.  
3. The player guesses letters by clicking on them.  
4. Correct letters appear in their correct positions.  
5. Incorrect guesses result in parts of the **hangman** being drawn.  
6. The game ends when:  
   - The player correctly guesses all letters (🎉 **Win!**)  
   - The player reaches the maximum number of incorrect guesses (**Game Over! 😢**)
